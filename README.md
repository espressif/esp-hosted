# ESP-Hosted-MCU: Espressif SoCs as Communication Co-Processors

## 1 Introduction

ESP-Hosted-MCU is an open-source solution that allows you to use Espressif Chipsets and modules as a communication co-processor. This solution provides wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) to the host microprocessor or microcontroller, enabling it to communicate with other devices. Additionally, the user has complete control over the co-processor's resources.

This high-level block diagram shows ESP-Hosted's relationship with the host MCU and slave co-processor.

For detailed design diagrams in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, refer to the following design documents:

- [WiFi Design](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/blob/feature/esp_as_mcu_host/docs/wifi_design.md)
- [Bluetooth Design](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/blob/feature/esp_as_mcu_host/docs/bluetooth_design.md)

This branch, `feature/esp_as_mcu_host` is dedicated for any host as MCU support. If you are interested in Linux as host, please refer to [`master`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/blob/master) branch.

## 2 Architecture

##### Hosted Co-Processor
This is an ESP chip that provides Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other capabilities. It is also referred as `hosted-slave` interchangeably.

##### Host MCU
This can be any generic microcontroller (MCU). We demonstrate any ESP as host. Using port layer, any host can act as host MCU.

##### Communication
- Host extends the capabilities of the Hosted co-processor through Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). The Host MCU sends these RPC commands to the Hosted co-processor using a reliable communication bus, like SPI, SDIO, or UART. The Hosted co-processor then handles the RPC and provides the requested functionality to the Host MCU.
- The data (network or Bluetooth) is packaged efficiently at the transport layer to minimize overhead and delays when passing between the Host and co-processor.
- This modular design allows any MCU to be used as the Host, and any ESP chip with Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth to be used as the Hosted co-processor. The RPC calls can also be extended to provide any function required by the Host, as long as the co-processor can support it.

## 3 Solution Flexibility

- **Any MCU can be the host**
  - You can evaluate ESP as an example host and then port ESP-Hosted to your desired MCU.
- **Any ESP chip can be the co-processor**
  - Any Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth capable ESP chipset can be chosen as co-processor
  - Choose the co-processor device based on your product requirements. The [ESP Product Selector](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs) can help in this.
- **Flexible transport layer (SDIO, SPI, UART)**
  - ESP-Hosted supports various communication interfaces between the host and the co-processor, allowing you to choose the most suitable one for your application.
  - Any other new transport also could be added to the open source code
- **Complete control over co-processor's resources**
  - The user is not limited to just using the co-processor for wireless connectivity. They have complete control over the co-processor's resources, allowing for a more flexible and powerful system.
- **Extensible RPC library**
  - The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) used by ESP-Hosted can be extended to provide any function required by the Host, as long as the co-processor can support it. Currently, the essential [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) Wi-Fi functions have been implemented.

## 4 Quick Demo with ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board

Impatient to test? We've got you covered!
The [ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-p4) can be used as a host MCU with an on-board [ESP32-C6](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6) as co-processor, already connected via SDIO as transport.
Prerequisite: You need to have an ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board`

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already set up ESP-IDF (version 5.3 or later), you can skip to [5 Source Code and Dependencies](#5-source-code-and-dependencies).

### 4.1 Set-Up ESP-IDF

- Windows
  - Install and setup ESP-IDF on Windows as documented in the [Standard Setup of Toolchain for Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html).
  - Use the ESP-IDF [Powershell Command Prompt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html#using-the-command-prompt) to move to expected

- Linux or MacOS
  - bash
```bash
bash docs/setup_esp_idf__latest_stable__linux_macos.sh
```
  - fish
```fish
fish docs/setup_esp_idf__latest_stable__linux_macos.fish
```

### 4.2 Set-Up P4 with C6
The host, ESP32-P4, lacks native Wi-Fi/Bluetooth support. Our [Quick Demo](docs/esp32_p4_function_ev_board.md) will help you run iperf over P4--SDIO--C6.

### 4.3 Don't Have ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board?

No worries if you don't have an ESP32-P4. In fact, most users don't. You can choose and use any two ESP chipsets/SoCs/Modules/DevKits. DevKits are convenient to use as they have GPIO headers already in place. From these two ESP chipsets, one would act as host and another as slave/co-processor. However, as these are not connected directly, you would need to manually connect some transport, which is explained later in the section [`Detailed Setup`](#7-detailed-setup).

## 5 Source Code and Dependencies

### 5.1 ESP-Hosted-MCU Source Code

- ESP-Hosted-MCU code can be found at Espressif Registry Component [`esp_hosted` (ESP-Hosted)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_hosted) or GitHub repo at [`ESP-Hosted`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/tree/feature/esp_as_mcu_host)

- ESP-Hosted repo clone is **not** required if you have ESP as host.
  - Reason: [ESP component manager](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager.html) automatically clones esp-hosted component while building.
- However, For non-ESP host development, you can clone the repo using command:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch feature/esp_as_mcu_host --depth 1 \
https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted esp_hosted_mcu
```

### 5.2 Dependencies

ESP-Hosted-MCU Solution is dependent on `ESP-IDF`, `esp_wifi_remote` and `protobuf-c`

###### ESP-IDF
  - [`ESP-IDF`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) is the development framework for Espressif SoCs supported on Windows, Linux and macOS
  - ESP-Hosted-MCU solution is based on ESP-IDF as base software. ESP chipsets as host and slave always tried to design such a way that ESP-IDF components are re-used.
  - Although, We totally understand, host MCUs in case of non-ESP chipset may not desire to be dependent on ESP-IDF. The port layer is written to avoid suc dependencies. Some crucial ESP-IDF components could also be just copy-pasted to fast-track the non-ESP host development.

###### Wi-Fi Remote
  - [`esp_wifi_remote`](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_wifi_remote) i.e. 'Wi-Fi Remote' is very thin interface made up of ESP-IDF Wi-Fi APIs with empty weak definitions. Real definitions for these APIs are provided by ESP-Hosted-MCU
  - Wi-Fi Remote Code can be found at either [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-protocols/tree/master/components/esp_wifi_remote) or [Espressif Registry Component](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_wifi_remote)

###### Protobuf
  - [`protobuf-c`](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) is data serialization framework provided by Google. RPC messages communicated in host and slave are protobuf encoded.
  - It helps to avoid manual serialization or endien-ness conversion.
  - Provides Flexibility for users to port the ESP-Hosted-MCU RPC framework in any protobuf supported programming language
  - Code is checked-out as submodule at `common/protobuf-c`

##### 5.2.1 How Dependencies Work Together (short explanation)
- RPC Request - Response
  - Wi-Fi Remote is an API layer or interface that provides the standard ESP-IDF Wi-Fi calls to the application (`esp_wifi_init()`, etc.)
  - Wi-Fi Remote forwards the Wi-Fi calls to ESP-Hosted, as ESP-Hosted 'implements' tha APIs provided by Wi-Fi Remote interface.
  - ESP-Hosted host MCU creates RPC requests which are protobuf encoded and sends over the transport (SPI/SDIO etc) to the slave.
  - Slave de-serialize the protobuf RPC request and response send back to host over transport, again with protobuf serialised.
  - Responses received at transport returned to Wi-Fi Remote, which returns the reponses to the calling app at host
  - To the app, it is as if it made a standard ESP-IDF Wi-Fi API call.
- RPC Event
  - Asynchronous Wi-Fi events when subscribed, are sent by slave to host.
  - These events terminate in standard ESP-IDF event loop on the host
- Please note, Only RPC i.e. control packets are serialised. Data Packets are never serialised as they do not need endien conversion.

## 6 Decide the communication bus in between host and slave

The communication bus is required to be setup correctly between host and slave.
We refer this as `transport medium` or simply `transport`.

ESP-Hosted-MCU supports SPI/SDIO/UART transports. User can choose which transport to use. Choosing specific transport depends on factors: high performance, easy and quick to test, number of GPIOs used, or simply co-processor preference

Below is chart for the transport medium comparison.

Legends:

- `FD` : Full duplex communication
- `HD` : Half duplex communication
- `BT` : Bluetooth
- `+2` in column `Num of GPIOs`
  - There are two GPIOs additional applicable for all the transports
  - (1) Co-Processor reset: Host needs one additional pin to connect to `RST`/`EN` pin of co-processor, to reset on bootup
  - (2) Ground: Grounds of both chipsets need to be connected.
  - If you use jumper cable connections, connect as many grounds as possible in between two boards for better noise cancellation.
- `Any_Slave`
  - Co-processor suppored: ESP32, ESP32-C2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C6, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3
  - Classic ESP32 supports 'Classic BT', 'BLE 4.2' & 'BTDM'
  - Rest all chipsets support BLE only. BLE version supported is 5.0+. Exact bluetooth versions could be refered from [ESP Product Selector Page](https://products.espressif.com/#/product-selector)
- `Dedicated platforms`
  - Bluetooth uses dedicated platform, UART and Wi-Fi uses any other base transport
  - In other platforms, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi re-use same platform and hence use less GPIOs and less complicated
  - This transport combination allows Bluetooth to use dedicated uart transportt with additional 2 or 4 depending on hardware flow control.
- (S) : Sheild box reading
- (O) : Over the air reading
- TBD : To be determined
- iperf : iperf2 with test results in mbps

**Host can be any ESP chipset or any non-ESP MCU.**

| Dedicated platforms | FD | Extra 2 or 4 | jumper or PCB | Any_Slave | NA | NA | UART dedicated for BT & Wi-Fi on any other transport |

> [!NOTE]
> - [1] Dual/Quad SPI is not supported on ESP32
>
> - [2] UART is only suitable for low throughput environments

With jumper cables, 'Standard SPI' and 'Dual SPI' solutions are easiest to evaluate, without much of hardware dependencies. SDIO 1-Bit can be tested with jumper cables, but it needs some additional hardware config, such as installation of external pull-up registers.

In case case of dedicated platforms, Blutooth uses standard HCI over UART. In rest of cases, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi uses same transport and hence less GPIOs and less complicated. In shared mode, bluetooth runs as vHCI (multiplexed mode)
