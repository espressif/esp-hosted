# Getting Started with MCU based host (STM32F469I)
Below diagram shows hardware and software block diagram for a typical MCU based system built with ESP-Hosted.

![ESP-Hosted Block Diagram](./MCU_based_design.png)

# 1. Development Environment Setup

## 1.1 Preconditions

### 1.1.1 STM32CubeIDE installation

We recommend STM32CubeIDE version 1.4 IDE from STMicroelectronics on host machine(Laptop, Desktop etc.). User can download IDE from [Here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#get-software).

### 1.1.2 Tools for testing
* **Arping**:
	Arping software is needed for testing the project.
	Arping is a software tool which probes hosts on the network link by sending Link Layer frames using the ARP request to host identified by its MAC address. More details could be found on [this link](https://devconnected.com/arping-command-on-linux-explained/).

	To install arping on ubuntu based system, please use
	```
	$ sudo apt install arping
	```
	For installation on Windows hosts, [check this link](https://elifulkerson.com/projects/arp-ping.php)

	arping can easily be installed on other architectures.

* **Serial port communication program**:
	For Linux and Mac development hosts, minicom is needed. For Windows based hosts Tera Term is needed.

### 1.1.3 ESP-Hosted Code Repository
Clone ESP-Hosted repository on machine, where STM32CubeIDE used to connect/flash to host.
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules <url_of_esp_hosted_repository>
$ cd esp-hosted
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# 2. Wi-Fi connectivity Setup over SPI
## 2.1 Hardware Setup/Connections
In this setup, ESP board acts as a SPI peripheral and provides Wi-Fi capabilities to host. Please connect ESP peripheral to STM32F469I board's CN12 Extension connecter with jumper cables as mentioned below. It may be good to use small length cables to ensure signal integrity.
BT/BLE support will be added in upcoming release.
Power ESP peripheral and STM32F469I separately with a power supply that provide sufficient power. ESP peripheral can be powered through PC using micro-USB cable. STM32 can be powered with mini-B cable. It is also used as USART connection for debug logs from host. Serial port communicaton program like tera term or minicom used to print the logs.

# 2. ESP peripheral setup
## 2.1 ESP-IDF requirement
:warning:`Note: ESP-IDF is needed to compile ESP-Hosted firmware source. Skip this step if you are planning to use pre-built release binaries.`

ESP-IDF release version to be used for ESP peripherals are

| ESP peripheral | ESP-IDF release |
|:----:|:----:|
| ESP32 | release v4.0 |
| ESP32-S2 | release v4.2 |
| ESP32-C3 | release v4.3 |
| ESP32-C3 (HCI over UART)| release v4.4 (beta)|

Clone appropriate ESP-IDF version as per your ESP peripheral. The control path between MCU host and ESP peripheral is based on `protobuf`. For that, corresponding stack layer, `protocomm` from ESP-IDF is used.

### 2.2 Setup
#### 2.2.1 Using pre-built binary
For pre built hosted mode firmware is present in `release` tab. Execute below command to flash it on ESP peripheral.

```sh
$ python esptool.py --chip <chipset> --port <serial_port> --baud <flash_baud_rate> --before default_reset \
--after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 40m \
0x1000 esp_hosted_bootloader_<chipset>_spi_v<release_version>.bin \
0x8000 esp_hosted_partition-table_<chipset>_spi_v<release_version>.bin \
0xd000 esp_hosted_ota_data_initial_<chipset>_spi_v<release_version>.bin \
0x10000 esp_hosted_firmware_<chipset>_spi_v<release_version>.bin

Where,
	<chipset>         : esp32/esp32s2/esp32c3
	<serial_port>     : serial port of ESP peripheral
	<flash_baud_rate> : flash baud rate of ESP peripheral, ex.115200, 921600, 2Mbps
	<release_version> : 0.1,0.2 etc. Latest from [release page](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/releases)
```
* This command will flash `SPI` interface binaries on ESP module.

For windows user, you can also program the binaries using ESP Flash Programming Tool.

#### 2.2.2 Compilation using source

Navigate to `esp/esp_driver/network_adapter` directory.

##### Using cmake

```
$ idf.py fullclean
```
:warning: Skip this step for ESP32. Run for ESP32-S2 or ESP32-C3 only.
```
$ idf.py set-target esp32s2
```
or
```
$ idf.py set-target esp32c3
```

Run following command and navigate to `Example Configuration -> Transport layer -> SPI interface -> select` and exit from menuconfig. Read more about [idf.py](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/api-guides/build-system.html#using-the-build-system) here.
```
$ idf.py menuconfig
```

:warning: Skip below step for ESP32-S2 or ESP32-C3. Run for  ESP32 only.

Change SPI controller to VSPI. Please navigate to `Example Configuration â†’ SPI Configuration` and change value of `SPI controller to use` to `3`

To build and flash the app on ESP peripheral, run

```sh
$ idf.py -p <serial_port> build flash
```
