# 2. ESP-Hosted Comprehensive Guide

### 2.1 Linux Host: Development Environment Setup
* This section list downs environment setup and tools needed to make ESP-Hosted solution work with Linux based host.
* If you are using Raspberry-Pi as a Linux host, both [section 2.1.1](#211-raspberry-pi-specific-setup) and [section 2.1.2](#212-additional-setup) are applicable.
* If you are using other Linux platform, skip to [section 2.1.2](#212-additional-setup)

#### 2.1.1 Raspberry-Pi Specific Setup
This section identifies Raspberry-Pi specific setup requirements.

* Linux Kernel Setup
	* We recommend full version Raspbian install on Raspberry-Pi to ensure easy driver compilation.
	* Please make sure to use kernel version `v4.19` and above. Prior kernel versions may work, but are not tested.
	* Kernel headers are required for driver compilation. Please install them as:
	```sh
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
	```
	* Verify that kernel headers are installed properly by running following command. Failure of this command indicates that kernel headers are not installed correctly. In such case, follow https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki and run `rpi-source` to get current kernel headers. Alternatively upgrade/downgrade kernel and reinstall kernel headers.
	```sh
	$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
	```

* Additional Tools
	* Raspi-gpio utility:
		```sh
		$ sudo apt install raspi-gpio
		```
	* Bluetooth Stack and utilities:
		```sh
		$ sudo apt install pi-bluetooth
		```

#### 2.1.2 Additional Setup
* Linux Kernel setup on non Raspberry-Pi
	* Please make sure to use kernel version `v4.19` and above. Prior kernel versions may work, but are not tested.
	* Please install kernel headers as those are required for driver compilation.
	* Verify that kernel headers are installed properly by running following command. Failure of this command indicates that kernel headers are not installed correctly.
	```sh
	$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
	```

* Install following tools on Linux Host machine.
	* Git
	* Python 2.x or 3.x: We have tested ESP-Hosted solution with python 2.7.13 and 3.5.3
	* Bluetooth Stack and utilities:
	  :warning:`Note: ESP-Hosted related BR/EDR 4.2 and BLE 4.2 functionalities are tested with bluez 5.43+. Whereas BLE 5.0 functionalities are tested with bluez 5.45+.`
		* bluetooth
		* bluez
		* bluez-tools
		* rfkill
		* bluez-firmware
	* We suggest latest stable bluez version to be used. Any other bluetooth stack instead of bluez also could be used.

### 2.2 ESP-IDF Setup
:warning:`Note: ESP-IDF is needed to compile ESP-Hosted firmware source. Skip this step if you are planning to use pre-built release binaries.`  

ESP-IDF release version to be used for ESP peripherals are

| ESP peripheral | ESP-IDF release |
|:----:|:----:|
| ESP32 | release v4.0 |
| ESP32-S2 | release v4.2 |
| ESP32-C3 | release v4.3 |
| ESP32-C3 (HCI over UART)| release v4.4 (beta)|

Clone appropriate ESP-IDF version as per your ESP peripheral. The control path between Linux host and ESP peripheral is based on `protobuf`. For that, corresponding stack layer, `protocomm` from ESP-IDF is used. Run following command in ESP-IDF directory to make `protocomm_priv.h` available for control path.
```
$ git mv components/protocomm/src/common/protocomm_priv.h components/protocomm/include/common/
```

### 2.3 ESP-Hosted Code Repository
Clone esp-hosted repository on Linux host.
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules <url_of_esp_hosted_repository>
$ cd esp-hosted
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2.4 ESP-Hosted Setup and Load Project

ESP-Hosted solutions supports SDIO and SPI as transport for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth/BLE connectivity. Bluetooth/BLE connectivity is supported over UART as well. Follow below setup guides according to transport layer of your choice.
